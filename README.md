# card_counter_ML
build the deck as lists
one list as the deck, another as the cards showing, a third list to show the house's cards, and a forth as discarded cards
build the NN to predict the next card on top, and calculate if it should take that card or hold.
ML needs to know all cards available to be played next, all cards showing, and what cards could tip them over 21. It also needs to weigh the value of the house's deck, and decide if it's worth risking a potential bust in order to beat the shown cards of the house.
Some shit about aces being multiple values
